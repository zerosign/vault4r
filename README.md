# vault4r

client library for vault using only `ring` derivative library and `hyper`. This library directly uses `hyper_rustls`.
Most of the types are carefully handcrafted rather than generated by their `swagger`spec API.

Currently, this library focuses into implementing http api for most of the `/sys/*` backend except `wrapping & `raw``.

This library heavily uses `type_alias_impl_trait` features in rust. Most of the endpoints are being implemented in
traits.
